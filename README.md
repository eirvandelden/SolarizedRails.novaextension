This is a rehash of two different themes: NovaRails and Pure Solarized. I like there is a Solarized theme, but I don't agree with the chosen colours. NovaRails does something I want, very clear and distinct colours for Ruby on Rails development. So, I've combined the two!

<!-- **Solarized (Rails)** provides a fun, bright palette:

Solarized (Rails) also offers a lighter alternative:
